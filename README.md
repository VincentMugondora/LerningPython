# My Python Learning Journey

## Description

This repository contains my code and notes as I learn Python. I'm using this space to practice fundamental concepts, work on small projects, and track my progress.

## Goals

*   Master the basics of Python syntax and data structures.
*   Understand control flow (if/else statements, loops).
*   Learn how to write functions and modules.
*   Explore basic file handling and data manipulation.
*   Build small, practical projects to apply my knowledge.

## Contents

*   `basics/`:  Contains code examples and exercises related to fundamental Python concepts (variables, data types, operators).
*   `control_flow/`:  Examples demonstrating if/else statements, for loops and while loops.
*   `functions/`:  Code for defining and using functions, including function arguments and return values.
*   `modules/`:  Examples of creating and importing modules.
*   `file_handling/`: Scripts that demonstrate reading from and writing to files.
*   `projects/`:  Small projects I'm working on to apply what I've learned.
*   `notes/`: A markdown file with notes.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository name]
    ```

2.  **Explore the directories:**  Each directory focuses on a specific topic.  Read the code examples and try modifying them.

3.  **Run the scripts:**  Use the Python interpreter to execute the `.py` files.  For example:

    ```
    python basics/my_first_script.py
    ```

4.  **Create your own files:**  Feel free to add your own code and experiment with the concepts.
